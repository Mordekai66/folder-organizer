  - Preserves original folder structure
  - Handles errors gracefully

- **Summary Reports**:
  - Auto-generated `summary.txt` files with file details

## Modular Architecture

The app is cleanly split into **5 logical modules**:

### `ui_manager.py` – GUI Layer  
- Builds the UI using Tkinter  
- Handles user interactions and theming  
- Updates status logs and progress in real-time  

### `file_organizer.py` – File Engine  
- Detects and classifies files  
- Manages file movement and renaming  
- Ensures safe operations with validations  

### `summary_writer.py` – Report Generator  
- Creates detailed and readable reports  
- Formats file sizes and timestamps  
- Handles per-folder and master reports  

### `file_utils.py` – Utility Toolkit  
- Gathers file info and performs checks  
- Provides helper tools for validation and backups  
- Includes system time estimation tools  

### `main.py` – App Entry Point  
- Orchestrates all modules  
- Manages startup, dependencies, and errors  
- Displays welcome messages and exits gracefully

## Example Output Structure

After organizing a folder, here's how it looks:

```
Your_Folder/
├── Images/
│   ├── photo1.jpg
│   └── summary.txt
├── Documents/
│   ├── notes.txt
│   └── summary.txt
├── Others/
│   ├── random_file.xyz
│   └── summary.txt
```

**Sample `summary.txt` content**:
```
Images - File Summary
==================================================
